# Solutions for competitive programming contests

## Description

This repository contains solutions written in [Python](https://www.python.org/)
for problems given at various online programming contests, code challenges or
other sites.

The primary objective of the code is to be **efficient** (to get a
as high as possible score), while still being **readable** and
**well-documented**, in order to serve as an educational resource.

## Background

I've never been very good at the algorithmic side of computer science.
While I know my data structures and complexities, there's quite a large gap
to being good at competitive programming challenges.

This repository will hopefully grow to become a valuable resource for people
who are also looking of getting into this area of computer science.

## Contests

This repository contains solutions for problems sampled from the following
programming contests:

- Google's [Kickstart](https://codingcompetitions.withgoogle.com/kickstart/)

## License

The code for the solutions is licensed under the permissive [MIT license](LICENSE.txt).
